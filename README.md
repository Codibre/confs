This is just a simple package to centralize IDE configuration of all codibre's projects

### How do I get set up

After installing it, just run

```
npx codibre-confs
```

You'll get instructions about each command you have at your disposal. We recommend you to install it in your project as a dev dependency, like this

```
npm install --save-dev codibre-confs
```

Basically, this package you create configuration files for nyc, mocha, tsconfig, eslint and others.
It also bring all this packages together, but you can always install it by yourself to ensure a newer version, of course!
